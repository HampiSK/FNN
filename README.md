# Flexible Neural Network (FNN)

FNN is a flexible, light weight and simple neural network that allows for unprecedented customization in network design.

- Imagine having each neuron using different activation function - Done.
- What about custom layer connections - Done, link neurons directly to/from any layer.
- Custom neuron properties - Done it too.
- Can I also choose how weights are updated - Yep, together with error an value, all yours.
- W-what if ... - Done.

Wow, that is amazing!
