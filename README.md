# C++ Flexible Neural Network (FNN)

FNN is a flexible, simple neural network library that allows for unprecedented customization in network design.

Imagine having each neuron using different activation function - done.
What about custom layer connections - done, link neurons directly to any layer.
Custom neuron creation - done it too.
W-what if ... - done.

Wow, that is amazing!
